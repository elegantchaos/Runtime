## Project Specific Rules

- This repository contains `Runtime`, a Swift package for cross-platform runtime metadata and environment helpers.
- Keep this package focused on runtime metadata and environment behavior.
- Prefer a small, explicit API surface with stable naming.
- Keep `RuntimeCore` platform-independent where possible.
- Isolate Apple-only behavior in Apple-specific modules or targets.
- Target modern Swift and prioritize Swift 6 concurrency-safe patterns.
- Keep Linux and Windows compatibility in mind for core APIs.
- Do not require UIKit or AppKit in core types.
- Put shared, platform-agnostic logic in `Sources/Runtime` and platform-specialized behavior behind conditional compilation or dedicated files/targets.
- Validate code changes with `swift test` and report any skipped validation.

## Standard Rules

- Always write good, modern, idiomatic code.
- Prefer fixing root causes over layered workarounds.
- Keep interfaces explicit and intentionally small.
- Avoid hidden coupling and surprising side effects.
- Write documentation to reflect the current state.
- Apply DRY, single-source-of-truth, KISS, YAGNI, make-illegal-states-unrepresentable, dependency injection, composition over inheritance, command-query separation, Law of Demeter, structured concurrency, design by contract, and idempotency.
- Understand request boundaries, inspect relevant code and docs before editing.
- Match change scope to the request: keep focused fixes small and coherent; use codebase-wide cleanup when the task is cleanup, review, modernisation, or consistency work.
- Use red/green TDD for non-UI code.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Create previews for UI code if UI code is introduced.
- Run the narrowest validation that proves the change first, then broaden to relevant project checks.
- Report skipped validation with the reason, validation gaps, and residual risks.
- Use trusted primary sources for technical decisions.
- Use portable path references in docs and guidance. Prefer repository-relative paths for files in this repository and `~/...` paths for shared resources outside it. Avoid machine-specific absolute paths.
- Never expose or commit credentials or secrets.
- Do not perform irreversible destructive actions without explicit approval. Reversible tracked-file deletions do not require extra approval beyond the user's request.
- Avoid unrelated refactors during focused tasks, but note them as follow-up work when needed.
- If unexpected workspace changes appear, pause and confirm direction.
- Do not repeatedly advertise that the agent is verifying instead of guessing; that should be treated as default competence and only called out when there is real uncertainty or risk.
